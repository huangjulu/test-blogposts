# Welcome to My First MDX Post

Hello, world! This is my first post using MDX. 

## What is MDX?

MDX is a powerful format that lets you seamlessly write JSX in your Markdown documents. It's a great tool for developers who want to create interactive blog posts or documentation.

Here are some things you can do with MDX:

1. Use Markdown syntax for basic formatting
2. Import and use React components
3. Write inline JSX

```jsx
import { Button } from './components/Button'

Click me!
```

That's it for now. Happy coding!
