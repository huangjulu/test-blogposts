# Welcome to MDX!

This is a sample MDX file that demonstrates various features of the MDX format.

## Basic Markdown

MDX supports all standard Markdown syntax:

- **Bold text**
- *Italic text*
- ~~Strikethrough~~

1. Ordered list item 1
2. Ordered list item 2

> This is a blockquote.

## Code Blocks

You can include code blocks with syntax highlighting:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}
```

## JSX and React Components

One of the powerful features of MDX is the ability to use JSX and React components directly in your Markdown:


## Dynamic Content

You can also include dynamic content using JavaScript expressions:

{new Date().getFullYear()}

## Custom Components

MDX allows you to use custom components to extend your content:

## Conclusion

MDX provides a flexible way to create rich, interactive content by combining the simplicity of Markdown with the power of React components.
